This is a page I use to practice working with website insights and data storytelling. 

Hi again!

<b>Why this presentation is here?</b></br>
As part of the bootcamp in marketing analytics we had several modules on data analysis and data storytelling. One of the tasks was to analyse a given report in Google Analytics here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nm0q433CSZAW2GiwqTsUcqDA-lt3ye9P/view and figure out why a big drop in April sales happened. The company's used MarTech stack was known and included WordPress, Shopify, GTM, Bing Ads, and CookieBot CMP. To tell the story of acquired data a PICA protocol - a purpose-insights-context-aesthetics method for assessing data - was used. A created presentation can serve as a basis for your own data story.
